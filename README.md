My CS32 final project

My Cs32 final project will use a GPS tracker on my phone to extract data on where I am during the week.

The computational task of the project will be building an algorithm that sorts the amount of time at each different location and then gives a detailed overview of a week of my whereabouts.

Interesting enough I can extend the scope of my final project, sine the GPS tracker that I used also collects speed at each collected data point.
