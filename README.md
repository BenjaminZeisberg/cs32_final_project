My CS32 final project

My Cs32 final project will use a GPS tracker on my phone to extract data on where I am during the week.

The computational task of the project will be building an algorithm that sorts the amount of time at each different location and then gives a detailed overview of a week of my whereabouts.

Interesting enough I can extend the scope of my final project, sine the GPS tracker that I used also collects speed at each collected data point.

1. We have to create a virtual environment to install the libraries that we need for the project(PyQt5, Folium).

How to install folium, since Pip gives us an error from (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44617159/python-3-6-module-cannot-be-found-folium):

From the source:

Choose the sandbox folder of your choice (~/sandbox for example)

$ mkdir visualization
$ cd visualization
Clone folium from github:

$ git clone https://github.com/python-visualization/folium
Run the installation script

$ cd folium
$ python setup.py install
