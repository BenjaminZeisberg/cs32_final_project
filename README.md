# cs32_final_project
My CS32 final project

My Cs32 final project will use a GPS tracker on my phone to extract data on where I am during the week.

The computational task of the project will be building an algorithm that sorts the amount of time at each different location and then gives a detailed overview of a week of my whereabouts.

Interesting enough I can extend the scope of my final project, sine I found this library called Folium, which allows me to plot the data on a real map.

There will be 7 maps for each day, and a heatmap that has the time spent at each marker saved as its weight. The documentation used were:

- https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

Thank you!
And Enjoy!
